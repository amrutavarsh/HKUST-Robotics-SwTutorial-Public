# Classwork

#### *Classwork 1*
> Construct a program that: [10 pts]
> - LEDs will light up alternatively
> - Only 1 LED should be on at the same time<br>
> e.g. [LED1 on(500ms)] -> (after 500ms) -> [LED2 on(500ms)] -> (after 500ms) -> [LED1 on]...

#### *Classwork 2*
> Construct a program that: [10 pts]
> - Buzzer beep twice when the mainboard just start
> - Each beep sound last for 300ms
> - There is a 500ms delay between two beep

#### *Classwork 3*
> 1. Construct a program that: [10 pts]
>		- LEDx will light up **ONLY** when BUTTONx is pressed (For BUTTON1 and BUTTON2)
>		- All LEDs will light up when BUTTON3 is pressed

<br>

> 2. Construct a program that: [20 pts]
>		- LEDx will light up only when BUTTONx is pressed
>		- All LEDs will light up when BUTTON3 is pressed
>		- If multiple buttons are pressed, only the action triggered by the first button will perform
>		- i.e. When BUTTON1 is pressed, pressing BUTTON2 will not light up LED2. After BUTTON1 is released while BUTTON2 is still being pressed, LED2 will light up.

<br>

> 3. Construct a program that: [10 pts]
>		- LEDx is toggled when BUTTONx is pressed (For BUTTON1 and BUTTON2)
>		- All LEDs are toggled when BUTTON3 is pressed

<br>

> 4. Construct a program that: [30 pts] (Partial credits for finishing a sub task)
>		- LEDx is toggled when BUTTONx is pressed (For BUTTON1 and BUTTON2)
>		- All LEDs are toggled when BUTTON3 is pressed
>		- Sub Task 1: [20 pts]
>		   - When the same button is pressed twice within 300ms, it is considered as a double click
>		   - Double click of Buttonx will toggle LEDx flashing, LEDx will flash one per 300ms
>		   - Double click of Button3 will toggle **both** LEDs flashing, LEDx will flash one per 300ms
>		   - Single click of a button will have no effect to the LED that is flashing
>		- Sub Task 2: [10 pts]
>		   - Buzzer will beep once for 100ms when there is a double click occur, no matter what button it is

<br>

> 5. Construct a program that: [10 pts]
>		- Buzzer beep x time(s) when Buttonx is pressed
>		- Each beep sound last for 300ms
>		- There is a 300ms delay between beeps
>		- When the buzzer is beeping, no action will be triggered if any buttons is pressed

**Remark:(For Classwork 3)**
- Finishing Question 2 is considered finishing both Question 1 and Question 2.
- Finishing Question 4 is considered finishing both Question 3 and Question 4.
